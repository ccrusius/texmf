TeX (LuaTeX) macros, including a true baseline grid alignment package.

CCGRID
======

Baseline alignment in TeX has been an unsolved problem for quite some time,
with various attempts, articles on TUGboat, etc. The reason it is hard is because
you really have to change the way TeX works down it its guts. That's what I
have done using LuaTeX, and I believe the problem is in principle solved. To
see how it is done, check out the [package PDF file](tex/plain/ccrusius/ccgrid.pdf).
