TeX (LuaTeX) macros, including a true baseline grid alignment package.

CCGRID
======

Baseline alignment in TeX has been an unsolved problem for quite some time,
with various semi-successful
attempts, articles on TUGboat about it, etc. The reason it is hard is because
you really have to change the way TeX works down in its guts. That's what I
have done using LuaTeX, and I believe the problem is in principle solved. To
see how it is done, check out the [package PDF file](tex/plain/ccrusius/ccgrid.pdf).
