% CATCODES
%
% Directly from 'tugboat.cmn'
%
%  The following allow for easier changes of category.  These require that
%  the character be addressed as a control-sequence: e.g. \makeescape\/ will
%  make the / an escape character.

% LUACODE
%
% Usage: \luacode <lua code> \endluacode
%
% Directly from LuaTeX's "Writing Lua in TeX," using the catcode routines
% defined above.
%
% To syntax highlight Lua code inside TeX, create a
% $VIMFILES/after/syntax/plaintex.vim file with the following contents:
%
%   unlet b:current_syntax
%   syn include @LUA syntax/lua.vim
%
%   syn region luatex matchgroup=contextIdentifier
